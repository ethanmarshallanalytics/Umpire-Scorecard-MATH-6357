# Umpire-Scorecard-MATH-6357

Project Description: The goal of the project is to predict the influence an umpire has on baseball games through their career. We have 19 variables in our raw dataset. Some of the impactful variables are, total_run_impact (response variable), accuracy, favor_home, incorrect_calls, umpire, and pitches_called. At the end, we will be able to predict which umpires have the most impact within the game.

Data: The data used comes from Umpire Scorecard (https://umpscorecards.com/games/) which is a website that collects data on umpire performance on a game level.
